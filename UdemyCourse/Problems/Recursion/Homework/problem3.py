'''
Create a function called word_split, which takes in a string
'phrase' and a set 'list_of_words'. 
The function will then determine if it is possible to split
the string in a way in which words can be made from the list
of words. 
You can assume the phrase will contain words found in the
dictionary if it is completely splittable
