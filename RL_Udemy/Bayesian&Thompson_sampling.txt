Thompson sampling

Let's think about confidence intervals again

We know intutitively that sample mean from 10 samples is less accurate 

Central Limit Theorem says that sample mean is approximately Gaussian

Xbar ~ Normal(Mu, sigma^2 / N)
Xbar ~ Normal(Mu, sigma^2)

Bayesian paradigm takes this a step further

Data is fixed; parameters are random

You want to find the distribution of the parameter given the data

SHould be more accurate than if you did not have the data

We call this the posterior:

	P{theta|X}
